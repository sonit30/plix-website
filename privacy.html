When you order products, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary.

Further, we also collect and store your Personal Information through sponsored social media platforms, events, etc. To protect your privacy, you should not provide the Company with any information that is not specifically requested or that you do not wish to share.
